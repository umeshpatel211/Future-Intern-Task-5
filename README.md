# Future-Intern-Task-5 :


Create a program that generates random passwords based on criteria defined by the user, 
such as length and complexity (e.g., including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, 
and special characters). The user inputs the desired length and selects the types of characters
to include. The program then generates and displays a random password meeting these specifications,
ensuring strong security and usability.
